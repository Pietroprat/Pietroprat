# Hello, I'm Pietro Pratesi! 👋
I’m a data analyst who believes that data can drive better decisions across any field—it’s all about understanding the problem. Currently, I apply my skills at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, based in Milan. The beauty of data analysis is that the same methods can be applied across different sectors, making me adaptable to any new challenge.

## 📊 What I Do:  
•	In my current role, I work extensively with high-dimensional data such as metagenomics and transcriptomics. My focus is on identifying biomarkers that can help guide clinical decision-making, using rigorous statistical methods to discover patterns and predictors of disease behavior.
•	A critical aspect of my work is ensuring that the data cleaning and preprocessing phase is handled with meticulous care. I firmly believe that high-quality data is the foundation for producing reliable and meaningful results. This involves handling missing data, identifying and correcting errors, transforming variables and ensuring that the dataset is properly structured. I see data preparation as not just a preliminary step but as the cornerstone of the entire analytical process. Without this careful attention, even the most sophisticated models can lead to misleading or inaccurate conclusions. 
•	The following step is to perform exploratory data analysis to uncover initial trends or correlations that can be further investigated. 
•	Once the data is properly prepared and explored, I apply advanced analytical techniques, including regression analysis, predictive modeling and machine learning. These methods enable me to identify patterns and key predictors related to the outcome of interest.
•	By following these steps, I can use models that are not only accurate, but also interpretable and clinically relevant, also obtaining generalizable results through the use of validation techniques.
•	The final step is to creating clear visualizations and reports, which are essential to translate intricate data into understandable formats to other professionals.
