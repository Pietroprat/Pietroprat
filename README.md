# Hello, welcome to Pietro Pratesi's profile! 👋
I’m a **data analyst** who believes that data can drive better decisions across any field—it’s all about understanding the problem. Currently, I apply my skills at the **Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori**, based in Milan. The beauty of data analysis is that the same methods can be applied across different sectors, making me adaptable to any new challenge.

## 📊 What I Do:  
-	In my current role, I work extensively with high-dimensional data such as **metagenomics** and **transcriptomics**. My focus is on identifying **biomarkers** that can help guide clinical decision-making, using rigorous statistical methods to discover patterns and predictors of disease behavior.
- A critical aspect of my work is ensuring that the **data cleaning** and **preprocessing** phase is handled with meticulous care. I firmly believe that high-quality data is the foundation for producing reliable and meaningful results. This involves **handling missing data**, identifying and **correcting errors**, **transforming variables** and ensuring that the dataset is properly structured. I see data preparation as not just a preliminary step but as the cornerstone of the entire analytical process. Without this careful attention, even the most sophisticated models can lead to misleading or inaccurate conclusions. 
- The following step is to perform **exploratory data analysis** to uncover initial trends or correlations that can be further investigated. 
- Once the data is properly prepared and explored, I apply advanced analytical techniques, including **regression analysis**, **predictive modeling** and **machine learning**. These methods enable me to identify patterns and key predictors related to the outcome of interest.
- By following these steps, I can use models that are not only **accurate**, but also **interpretable** and relevant, also obtaining generalizable results through the use of **validation techniques**.
- The final step is to creating **clear visualizations** and **reports**, which are essential to translate intricate data into understandable formats to other professionals.
